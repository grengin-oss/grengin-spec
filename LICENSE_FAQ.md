# Grengin Licensing FAQ

Common questions about Grengin's dual licensing model and the Sustainable Use License (SUL).

---

## General Questions

### What is the Grengin Sustainable Use License?

The Grengin SUL is a dual-license model that allows:
- **Free use** for individuals, small businesses, non-profits, and non-commercial purposes
- **Paid commercial licenses** for larger companies using Grengin in commercial contexts

This approach ensures sustainable development while keeping the software accessible to those who need it most.

### Why not use MIT/Apache/BSD license?

Pure open source licenses don't provide sustainable funding for development. Our model:
- Keeps the software free for 95%+ of users
- Funds ongoing development, security patches, and support
- Prevents large corporations from benefiting without contributing back
- Maintains transparency with fully available source code

### Why not use AGPL or similar copyleft licenses?

While copyleft licenses ensure code sharing, they:
- Don't provide direct funding for development
- Can be incompatible with commercial software
- May deter legitimate business users who would be willing to pay

Our SUL is more permissive than AGPL for small users while being more sustainable than MIT/Apache.

## Who Needs a Commercial License?

### Do I need a commercial license?

You need a commercial license if **ALL** of the following are true:
1. Your organization has **≥$5M USD** annual revenue
2. You're using Grengin for **commercial purposes**
3. The software provides **direct business value** or revenue generation

### What counts as "$5M annual revenue"?

- **Gross revenue** of your organization and all affiliated entities
- Based on your most recent **fiscal year**
- Converted to USD using average exchange rates
- Includes parent companies and subsidiaries

**Examples:**
- Startup with $3M revenue → Free ✅
- Bootstrapped company with $6M revenue → Commercial license required ❌
- Individual consultant with $200K revenue → Free ✅
- Enterprise division with own $3M revenue but parent company has $100M → Commercial license required ❌

### What is "commercial use"?

Commercial use means using Grengin for commercial advantage or monetary compensation:

**Commercial Use (may require license):**
- Integrating Grengin into a product you sell
- Using Grengin to provide services to customers
- Using Grengin in revenue-generating operations
- Deploying Grengin for customer-facing applications

**Non-Commercial Use (free):**
- Personal projects and learning
- Academic research
- Open source projects
- Internal tools that don't generate revenue

### What about internal tools?

Internal tools are generally free **if they don't directly generate revenue:**

**Free Examples:**
- HR management system
- Internal documentation site
- Development/staging environments
- Employee productivity tools
- CI/CD pipelines

**Requires License:**
- Tools that directly support revenue generation (e.g., sales CRM)
- Customer support systems
- Production analytics for paid services
- Infrastructure for paid products
