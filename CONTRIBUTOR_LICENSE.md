# Grengin Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Version 1.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Grengin (the "Project"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the Project.

---

## Why Do We Need a CLA?

This Agreement:
- Clarifies the intellectual property rights in your contributions
- Grants us the rights to use your contributions in both Community and Enterprise editions
- Protects you, us, and users of the Project
- Ensures we can defend the Project legally
- Allows us to maintain a sustainable dual-license model

**You retain full ownership of your contributions** - the CLA only grants us rights to use them.

## Who Needs to Sign?

### Small Contributions
For minor contributions (typos, small bug fixes, documentation improvements under 50 lines), you can contribute under the implicit agreement included with your pull request.

### Significant Contributions
For larger contributions, new features, or architectural changes, we'll ask you to sign this CLA by commenting on your pull request with:

```
I agree to the Contributor License Agreement as outlined in CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE.md
```

### Corporate Contributors
If you're contributing on behalf of your employer, we'll need a Corporate CLA signed by an authorized representative. Contact legal@grengin.com for the corporate CLA.
